I plan to make a warrior cats inspired text baed adventure game. I was inspired by the text adventure games in the student showcase video and plan to implement many of the features from there onto this project.

Features it will have include an inventory system, a dialogue system, npcs, game progression, and stats. Randomness will also be a necessary feature for this project.

My guess as to how many of these things will be executed include having to use the "def" function a lot. Since we already have covered randomness is this course I think it will be easy to put this in the game. I think, to code NPCs, it will be much like coding a object but will of course be more detailed and in depth, depending on how advanced i want the npc to be.
