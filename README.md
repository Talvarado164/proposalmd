I plan to make a warrior cats inspired text baed adventure game. I was inspired by the text adventure games in the student showcase video and plan to implement many of the features from there onto this project.

Features it will have include an inventory system, a dialogue system, npcs, game progression, and stats. Randomness will also be a necessary feature for this project.

My guess as to how many of these things will be executed include having to use the "def" function a lot. Since we already have covered randomness is this course I think it will be easy to put this in the game. I think, to code NPCs, it will be much like coding a object but will of course be more detailed and in depth, depending on how advanced i want the npc to be.

I wasn't planning to include anything particularly new but I know there will be a lot of times where I have to search up or ask about how to do something. I think if I were to code actual animations that will absolutely be something I have to look into.

My ideal outcome for this project would be to create a game that focuses mainly on dialogue and choices that the player makes to be able to make it to leadership within the world. I think to make it more exciting I will try to implement some pixel sprite art if applicable. I would also like for there to be many different endings (good and bad), with some being 'rarer' than others.

However, the minimal outcome would be to create a text based adventure game that features the player having one simple objective and for the storyline to be linear and for very little things to branch off the main storyline. It would mean that the game would be repetitive and boring, however, I think that I will be able to at least implement a few different storylines.
